# Communication Theory Matlab Live Scripts

This repo is a collection of the Matlab Live Scripts I wrote to learn how to
solve communication theory questions while studying electrical engineering at
Western.

Some of the topics covered in these scripts are:
    - Forward Error Correction (FEC) 
    - Hamming Code
    - Repetition Code
    - Information Theory
    - Shannon Capacity
    - Entropy and Confusion
    - Sampling Theory
    - Friis Transmission Equation
    - Statistics (Q Functions)
    - Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) 
    - Bit Error Rate (BER)
    - Compression


I converted all of the live scripts (.mlx) to normal Matlab files (.m) so some
of the formatting and comments may seem formatted strangely. The original .mlx
files can be found in [live-scripts](live-scripts).

I wrote these before my skills as a programmer really improved so please don't
judge the code repetition too harshly.

Please checkout [my subnetting tool](https://github.com/anakin4747/subnet)
which properly highlights my improvements as a C developer / network engineer.
