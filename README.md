# Communication Theory Matlab Live Scripts

This repo is a collection of the Matlab Live Scripts I wrote to learn how to
solve communication theory questions while studying electrical engineering at
Western.

I wrote these before my skills as a programmer really improved so please don't
judge the code repetition too harshly.

Please checkout [my subnetting tool](https://github.com/anakin4747/subnet)
which properly highlights my improvements as a C developer / network engineer.
